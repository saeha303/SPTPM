not time series:
sId-0 to 1460, H time granularity
G is 23-finer than H, why did they decide to take it 23 though? Data of one day, why not 24 then?

1420066800, 1420124400 are not in start for H1. What do we do when we have missing data for a time instant?

Maybe dipshit's do know how to mine patterns,
but they don't have the slightest idea how to code like a normal human being
what's wrong with the variable names man?
minDensity should be minden throughout the whole code,
how did it become minPS?
God, human being are the dumbest shit on this planet's surface
